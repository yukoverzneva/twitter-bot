# twitter-bot
The aim was to create a bot that tweets photos of resting dogs once a day.
I created a twitter account @RestingDogsBot. Managed to post my first "Hello, world!" tweet via Tweepy. Succeed to make a bot post photos from file, set a timer. Then failed to understand how to automate tweeting photos everyday from cloud where.
So, the code I finally have is not what I really wanted, but it is what it is.
